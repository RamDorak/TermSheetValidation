A Write-Down may occur on more than one occasion and (if applicable) the Bonds may be written down following one or more Reinstatements pursuant to Condition 41(ii)(b) (Reinstatement). Once the principal of a Bond has been written down pursuant to this Condition 41(ii)(a) (Temporary write down), it may only be restored in accordance with Condition 41(ii)(b) (Reinstatement). If the Issuer is amalgamated with any other bank pursuant to Section 44 A the BR Act before the Bonds have been written down, the Bonds will become part of the Additional Tier 1 capital of the new bank emerging after the merger. If the Issuer is amalgamated with any other bank after the Bonds have been written down pursuant to a CET1 Trigger Event, the amalgamated bank can reinstate these instruments according to its discretion. Further, if the Issuer is amalgamated or acquired by another bank after being written down pursuant to a CET1 Trigger Event and the holders of equity shares get positive compensation on such amalgamation or acquisition, the holders of Bonds which have been written down pursuant to a CET1 Trigger Event will have to be appropriately compensated. 11"
